A simple Apple Watch App that represents your life as a clock.


The idea is to think of your entire life as a single in your waking life:
- You are born at 7a (or whenever you tend to wake up)
- You die at 11p (or whenver you tend to go to sleep)
- By assuming you live to be 90 and measuring the time elapsed since you were born, the App shows the current "Life time"

The app is really intended to be used as a complication, as a way of bringing mindfulness to our own mortality as well as the preciousness of life. 
The original inspiration for the app was reflecting on the feeling one gets at the end of a fulfilling day â€“ the evening comes without dread, as a welcome time of
reflection, quiet and rest. I would like to be so lucky as to feel that way toward the end of my life, as well.

My goal for this was just to be able to use it on my own wrist, so it is pretty rough at this stage. The birthday, for example, is hard coded in. I may or may not choose to spend more time on it, depending on what I learn from using it.
